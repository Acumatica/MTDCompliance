MTD Compliance
==================================

Making Tax Digital (MTD) is a UK government initiative that requires most UK taxpayers to send HM Revenue and Customs (HRMC) summaries of their income and expenditure at least four times a year. 
Additional information is available from the HM Revenue and Customs website: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-tax-digital/overview-of-making-tax-digital
